This is Theodolite, a surveyer's tool
=====================================

__Summary__

Theo allows users to makes simple surveys in a web form.  In their survey they
can have a wide variety of questions.  (New question types are easily added --
within minor technical limits -- by putting the HTML code into the database.)
Users then upload a file of people to whom emails will be sent containing a 
link to the survey.

Subjects receive the email, and click to take the survey.  They access the
survey through an identifier, and when the system records their response
then it also remembers that they responded and will not allow them to respond
twice.  


__For More__

See the file html/index.html for the technical points.  Basically, you need
Python, PostgreSQL, and the ability to install the scripts (e.g, if you have
a Linux machine connected to the Internet then you are set).
