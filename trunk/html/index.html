<h3 class='subhead'>In brief</h3>
<p>
This software runs surveys over the web.
</p>

<p>
Survey givers fill out web forms to make a survey, 
and also to provide the system with a list of survey-takers email addresses.
These survey takers are then sent an email asking for their response.
The survey-givers can see the results on the web, 
or download them for further analysis.
</p>

<div class='section' />
<h3 class='subhead'>Key points</h3>

<p>
Theodolite has a number of features that are appealing
to the survey-giver (the Theo user), to the survey takers
(the subjects), and to the system administrator.
</p>

<ul>
<li />
Survey givers make up their own survey by filling out a web form.

<li />
Survey givers can choose from a wide variety of question types, 
such as yes-no or rate-one-to-ten.
Questions can have multiple values, such as &quot;check all that apply.&quot;
Administrators can add new question types 
by entering HTML into the database&nbsp;--
new question types do not require new programming.

<li />
Surveys cannot go out without being approved.
This is done on a simple web form, so routine Theodolite 
administration can be done by a nontechnical person. 

<li />
Survey givers also upload a file listing their subjects.
This file has a simple format: for each subject there is a separate line,
with an id and an email.
Because the file is simple, it is easy to 
get the information from a database, mailing list, etc.

<li />
Each subject of each survey is assigned a unique identifier at upload time.
The system uses these
to prevent a subject from answering any survey multiple times.
The identifiers are long random strings, so
no one can forge responses by guessing identifiers.

<li />
On the day that the survey opens, 
each subject is emailed a message.
This message was written by the survey giver.
Each email contains only one address so no
one sees the email address of any other subject.
It has a link that subjects click to take the survey.
That link contains an identifier so the system can tell what survey 
the subject is taking.

<li />
Survey givers can have subjects sent
one or two prompting emails at selected dates after the survey opens.
The wording of these prompts is entirely up to the survey giver.
The system prompts only the subjects that have not yet responded. 

<li />
Survey givers establish a closing date, and 
no responses are allowed after that date.

<li />
Survey givers can view a page giving the results of their survey,
using a password.
They can view that page during the survey, or after.
That page contains a simple analysis, and allows the user to download
the full results of the survey, so that the data can be imported into any
statistical package or spreadsheet for full analysis. 
Because subjects have an identifier, survey givers 
can answer questions like,
&quot;What percentage of subjects who responded yes to question&nbsp;1
also responded yes to question&nbsp;5?&quot;

<li />
For specialized circumstances,
survey givers can have survey responses be anonymous.
Subjects will still not be able to answer multiple times, 
but the CSV file will only list responses as being from
&quot;anonymous&quot;.
(The &quot;specialized circumstance&quot; 
is that this makes the analysis mentioned 
in the previous item impossible;
this is so that a user cannot tell that the person who responded
&quot;21&quot; and &quot;male&quot; early in the survey is the 
same person who responded &quot;no&quot; to a later question.)

<li />
Survey givers can offer one of those goofy
web surveys where anyone can answer, any number of times.
(Note that in this case, some of the other properties of surveys are affected; 
for instance, there are no mailings.)
Theo allows this because Theo has a sense of humor, too.

<li />
Survey givers can have the
system email them the results each time that 
a subject responds (this may be useful in small surveys, or as a 
backup for those who have seen one too many system crashes). 

<li />
Theo is based on software that is 
widely-available, standards-compliant, and free.
Installation is easy. 
The footprint is small
(Python CGI scripts,
some SQL that is known to work with PostgreSQL, 
and a Python cron job to send the emails) so maintainence is easy.
The code is not very large, and is easily modified by a technical person.

</ul>

<h3 class='subhead'>Examples</h3>
<p>
Here are some ways that you might use this system.
</p>

<ol>
<li />
A college can set up a Theo system. 
For instance, to see what students think of the new meal plan, all students 
could be emailed, using a list generated by the registrar.
The results can be imported into statistical software for complex analysis.
(This is Theo's target application.)

<li />
A club could survey its members, without having to worry about
stamps, stuffing envelopes, etc.,
or the cost of using an online survey provider.
Answers can be anonymous, in case the membership is concerned
about how the responses will be handled.

<li />
A high school teacher giving a statistics class who wants to have
students in the class only survey the other students 
can set a configuration variable
to always use the same list of subjects.
Then students can then enter and interpret their own surveys.
