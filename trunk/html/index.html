<h2>Theodolite: a tool for surveyers</h2>

<div class='section' />
<h3 class='subhead'>In brief</h3>
<p>
This software runs surveys over the web.
</p>

<p>
Survey givers fill out web pages to make up their own survey, 
and also to provide the system with a list of survey-takers.
These survey takers are then sent an email asking for their response.
The survey-givers can see the results on the web, 
or download them for further analysis.
</p>

<div class='section' />
<h3 class='subhead'>Key points</h3>

<p>
Theodolite has a number of features that are appealing
to the survey-giver (the Theo user), to the survey takers
(the subjects), and to the system administrator.
</p>

<ul>
<li />
Users make up their own survey by filling out a web form.

<li />
Users can choose from a wide variety of question types, 
such as yes-no or rate-one-to-ten.
Questions can have multiple values, such as &quot;check all that apply.&quot;
Administrators can add new question types 
by entering HTML into the database&nbsp;--
new question types do not require new programming.

<li />
Surveys cannot go out without being approved by a Theo administrator.
This is done on a simple web form, so routine Theodolite 
administration can be done by a nontechnical person. 

<li />
Users upload a file listing the subjects that they wish to survey.
This file has a simple format: for each subject there is a separate line,
with an id and an email.
Because the file is simple, users can easily 
get the information from a database, mailing list, etc.

<li />
Each subject of each survey is assigned a unique identifier at upload time.
The system uses these
to prevent a subject from answering any survey multiple times.
The identifiers are long random strings, so
no one can forge responses by guessing identifiers.

<li />
On the day that the survey opens, 
each subject is emailed a message.
This message was written by the user when the survey was entered.
Each email contains only one address so no
one sees the email address of any other subject.
It has a link that subjects click to take the survey.
That link contains the subject identifier,
which is not just unique within the survey, but also unique across surveys as
well, so the system can tell what survey the users will take.

<li />
Users can set up their survey so that subjects will be sent
one or two prompting emails, at selected dates after the survey opens.
The wording of these prompts is entirely up to the user.
The system uses the fact that subjects have identifiers to
prompt only the ones that have not yet responded. 

<li />
Users establish a closing date for their survey and 
no responses are allowed after that date.

<li />
Users can view a page giving the results of their survey,
using a password that they entered while setting up the survey.
They can view that page during the survey, or after.
That page contains a simple analysis, and allows the user to download
the full results of the survey in the CSV format (comma-separated values), 
which can be imported into any
statistical package or spreadsheet for full analysis. 
Because subjects have an identifier, users 
can answer questions like, 
&quot;What percentage of subjects who responded yes to question&nbsp;1
also responded yes to question&nbsp;5?&quot;

<li />
For specialized circumstances,
users can select to have survey
responses be anonymous.
Subjects will still not be able to answer multiple times, 
but the CSV file will only list responses as being from
&quot;anonymous&quot;.
(The specialized circumstance is that this makes the analysis mentioned 
in the previous item impossible;
the advantage is that a user cannot tell that the person who responded
&quot;21&quot; and &quot;male&quot; early in the survey is the 
same person who responded &quot;no&quot; to a later question.)

<li />
Users can offer one of those goofy
web surveys where anyone can answer, any number of times.
Theo allows this because Theo has a sense of humor, too.
Note that in this case, some of the other properties of surveys are affected; 
for instance, there are no mailings.

<li />
Users can also select to have the
system email them the results each time that 
a subject responds (this may be useful in small surveys, or as a 
backup for users who have been burned once too often). 

<li />
Theo is based on software that is 
widely-available, standards-compliant, and free.
Installation is easy. 
The footprint is small
(it uses Python CGI scripts,
some SQL that is known to work with PostgreSQL, 
and a Python cron job to send the emails, so 
there is no web publishing environment to worry about).
The code is not very large, and is easily modified by a technical person.

</ul>

<h3 class='subhead'>Examples</h3>
<p>
Here are some ways that you might use this system.
</p>

<ol>
<li />
A college can set up a Theo system. 
For instance, to see what students think of the new meal plan, all students 
could be emailed, using a list generated by the registrar.
The results can be imported into statistical software for complex analysis.
(This is Theo's target application.)

<li />
A club could survey its members, without having to worry about
stamps, stuffing envelopes, etc.,
or the cost of using an online survey provider.
Answers can be anonymous, in case the membership is concerned
about how the responses will be handled.

<li />
A high school teacher giving a statistics class who wants to have
students in the class only survey the other students 
can set a configuration variable
to always use the same list of subjects.
Then students can then enter and interpret their own surveys.

</ol>
