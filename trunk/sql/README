NOTES ABOUT STOCKING WITH NEW QUESTIONS

  1) You can use either 'radio' questions or 'checkbox' questions; just be
  sure to set multiple to be 'False' in the 'radio' case and multiple to be
  'True' in the 'checkbox' case.

  2) The legal answers have to be strings, because PostgreSQL does not allow
  'TEXT OR INTEGER' as a data type (obviously).  

  3) For any question_type, you specify that when results are shown you want 
  averages and standard deviations taken by declaring 'quantitative' to be 
  'TRUE' (but without the quotes in the .sql).

  Note the field in the legal_answers table called 'analyzable'.  Suppose that
  you want to ask "Rate 1 to 5" and you have answers coded 1, 2, .. 5.  If you
  want also to have an answer coded 0 for 'no opinion' then you don't want
  that 0 as part of the mean or std dev.  So set the legal_answers row as:
    q_type,answer,analyzable = ('onetofivewithnoopinion','0',FALSE) 
  .

  4) For any question_type, you specify that when results are shown you want 
  the frequency distribution of the answers to be shown (as opposed to just 
  a listing, such as you would employ for a comment-type question) by setting 
  'bar_chart' to be 'TRUE' (but without the quotes in the .sql).

  5) The legal answers will be shown on the results page in the same order in
  which they are entered into the database.
