These need to be done:

  * Check mails.py as a cron job

Longer term possibilities:

  * In the CSV file, show the surveyer the id of the person as uploaded, or 
    as generated by the system?
  * Allow users to customize the CSV format?
  * Make a way to set up a survey that is anonymous but that requires no 
    subject id?
  * Generate graphics for results page
  * Make the survey id be a random string?
